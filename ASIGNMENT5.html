I flowed with great enthusiasm and strength, oblivious of the harsh tract that I had to trace to reach the valley below.  I was surrounded by beauty all along the path I flowed that was rich with trees, flowers, and the precious water and silt that I brought  down along with me were of great importance and of great use to the  people who settled on my banks.";

		<form><h1> A RIVER'S STORY </h1>
			<div><p id="p1">Let me introduce myself to you. I am Kanari,  born as a river from the lap of the  Ghutehi hills in Ghutehi village from Jabalpur district in Madhya Pradesh. I flowed down the hills as a dancing damsel  showering love and warmth everywhere on my way towards unknown regions. Throughout my childhood, I was surrounded by greenery and trees and flowers were my friends.</div></p></div>

		<form><h1> Paragram 02 </h1>
			<div><p id="p1">Even though I was not a very big river and had an expanse of  298 km2,  I was  big enough to support livelihoods of people who stayed along my banks  and it  felt great to be useful to so many people and the environment. I also found a companion along the way, the Suhar river who was  just like my little sister.  Myself and the Suhar river traverse a long course together until we finally meet our mother the Narmada!</div></p></div></form>

		<form><h1> Paragram 03 </h1>
			<div><p id="p1">But these joyful moments were short lived and my condition deteriorated day by day. My situation right now almost seems pitiable. Humans staying on my banks and who I considered my well wishers turned out to be my biggest enemies.  Inspite of  industrialisation, commercialisation and liberalisation that I witnessed after independence, my land is still an agrarian land as 70-75 percent of the population still depends on agriculture.</div></p></div></form>

		<form><h1> Paragram 04 </h1>
			<div><p id="p1">I even witnessed the Green Revolution around the sixties, that proved out to be a boon in terms of enhancing agricultural productivity, but it exploited my river bed beyond repair.

I am disheartened and shattered when I look around, the forest cover in the mountains is gone, my plains and valleys are no more beautiful, my people are starving, robbed of their livelihoods because of my pitiable condition.  I am voiceless and very angry on being neglected by people inspite of having served them for a long time.</div></p></div></form>
